        Pilgrimage in Hinduism, as in other religions, is the practice of journeying to sites where religious powers,
         knowledge, or experience are deemed especially accessible. Hindu pilgrimage is rooted in ancient scriptures.
          According to textual scholars, the earliest reference to Hindu pilgrimage is in the Rigveda.Pilgrimage has been 
          increasingly popular since the 20th century,facilitated by ever-improving transportation.But due to any
           inconvenience visit is not possible this application tries to give a virtual visit to various Indian temples.
